# rp-nano
## Tiny RP2040 based board, ideal for USB HID applications, i.e USB rubber ducky.

I designed this mainly for rubber ducky applications. It's extremely similar to the [picoducky](https://github.com/Outdatedcandy92/PicoDucky), but rp2040 based, and I started designing it before i knew picoducky was a thing. I created because I wanted a small, cheap (\**laughs in trump tax*\*), board that could be used for general HID tasks, or even a one LED+tactile switch microcontroller project.
