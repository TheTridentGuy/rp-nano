8h

I spent a bit of yesterday and most of today redoing my layout and all my traces, and I also made some other major changes based on suggestions from people in the slack.
I also switched to a 4 layer PCB, as it allowed for much cleaner routing. Heres my latest, and very close to final version:

Due to my failure to base my project off of basic parts, and use of the wrong LDO and I'm going to redo my layout, and most of my routing.

### July 2:

8h

I got really carried today and spent basically the entire day working on this, and I've completed the entire schematic, and most of the PCB. I chose
to do the PCB routing by hand, which took more time, but allowed me to keep in mind which connections needed to be optimized.
